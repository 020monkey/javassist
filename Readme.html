<h1>Javassist version 2</h1>

<h3>in May, 2003.

<p>Javassist (JAVA programming ASSISTant) makes Java bytecode manipulation
simple.  It is a class library for editing bytecodes in Java;
it enables Java programs to define a new class at runtime and to
modify a class file when the JVM loads it.  Unlike other similar
bytecode editors, Javassist provides two levels of API: source level
and bytecode level.  If the users use the source-level API, they can
edit a class file without knowledge of the specifications of the Java
bytecode.  The whole API is designed with only the vocabulary of the
Java language.  You can even specify inserted bytecode in the form of
source text; Javassist compiles it on the fly.  On the other hand, the
bytecode-level API allows the users to directly edit a class file as
other editors.

<h2>How to run sample programs</h2>

<p>JDK 1.2.2 or later is needed.

<h3>1. Move to the directory where this Readme.html file is located.</h3>

<p>In the description below, we assume that the platform is JDK 1.2
(or later) for Solaris.  If the platform is JDK 1.2 (or later) for
Windows, the class-path option is:

<ul><pre>
-classpath ".;javassist.jar"
</pre></ul>

<p>If you don't want to put the class-path option, copy
<tt>./javassist.jar</tt> to

<ul>&lt;<i>java-home</i>&gt;<tt>/jre/lib/ext/</tt>.</ul>

<p>&lt;<i>java-home</i>&gt; depends on the system.  It is usually
<tt>/usr/local/java</tt>, <tt>c:\jdk1.2\</tt>, etc.

<p>If you don't use javassist.jar, first compile Javassist:
<ul><pre>
% cd src
% javac -d .. javassist/*.java javassist/*/*.java
% cd ..
</pre></ul>

<p>Then you can compile and run the sample programs without the class-path
option.

<h3>2. sample/Test.java</h3>

<p>   This is a very simple program using Javassist.

<p>   To run, type the commands:

<ul><pre>
% javac -classpath ".:javassist.jar" sample/Test.java
% java -cp ".:javassist.jar" sample.Test
</pre></ul>

<p>   For more details, see <a type="text/plain" href="sample/Test.java">sample/Test.java</a>

<h3>3. sample/reflect/*.java</h3>

<p>   This is the "verbose metaobject" example well known in reflective
   programming.  This program dynamically attaches a metaobject to
   a Person object.  The metaobject prints a message if a method
   is called on the Person object.

<p>   To run, type the commands:

<ul><pre>
% javac -classpath ".:javassist.jar" sample/reflect/*.java
% java -cp ".:javassist.jar" javassist.reflect.Loader sample.reflect.Main Joe
</pre></ul>

<p>Compare this result with that of the regular execution without reflection:

<ul><pre>% java -cp ".:javassist.jar" sample.reflect.Person Joe</pre></ul>

<p>   For more details, see <a type="text/plain" href="sample/reflect/Main.java">sample/reflect/Main.java</a>

<p>   Furthermore, the Person class can be statically modified so that
   all the Person objects become reflective without sample.reflect.Main.
   To do this, type the commands:

<ul><pre>
% java -cp ".:javassist.jar" javassist.reflect.Compiler sample.reflect.Person -m sample.reflect.VerboseMetaobj
</pre></ul>

<p>   Then,
<ul><pre>
% java -cp ".:javassist.jar" sample.reflect.Person Joe
</pre></ul>

<h3>4. sample/duplicate/*.java</h3>

<p>   This is another example of reflective programming.

<p>   To run, type the commands:

<ul><pre>
% javac -classpath ".:javassist.jar" sample/duplicate/*.java
% java -cp ".:javassist.jar" sample.duplicate.Main
</pre></ul>

<p>Compare this result with that of the regular execution without reflection:

<ul><pre>% java sample.duplicate.Viewer</pre></ul>

<p>For more details, see
<a type="text/plain" href="sample/duplicate/Main.java">sample/duplicate/Main.java</a>

<h3>5. sample/vector/*.java</h3>

<p>This example shows the use of Javassit for producing a class representing
a vector of a given type at compile time.
This is a demonstration of the use of <tt>javassist.preproc</tt> package.

<p>   To run, type the commands:
<ul><pre>
% javac -classpath ".:javassist.jar" sample/vector/*.java
% java -cp ".:javassist.jar" javassist.preproc.Compiler sample/vector/Test.j
% javac sample/vector/Test.java
% java sample.vector.Test
</pre></ul>

<p>For more details, see
<a type="text/plain" href="sample/vector/Test.j">sample/vector/Test.j</a>
and <a type="text/plain" href="sample/vector/VectorAssistant.java">sample/vector/VectorAssistant.java</a>

<h3>6. sample/rmi/*.java</h3>

<p>   This demonstrates the javassist.rmi package.

<p>   To run, type the commands:
<ul><pre>
% javac -classpath ".:javassist.jar" sample/rmi/*.java
% java -cp ".:javassist.jar" sample.rmi.Counter 5001
</pre></ul>

<p>   The second line starts a web server listening to port 5001.

<p>   Then, open <a href="sample/rmi/webdemo.html">sample/rmi/webdemo.html</a>
with a web browser running
   on the local host.  (<tt>webdemo.html</tt> trys to fetch an applet from
   <tt>http://localhost:5001/</tt>, which is the web server we started above.)

<p>   Otherwise, run sample.rmi.CountApplet as an application:

<ul><pre>
% java -cp ".:javassist.jar" javassist.web.Viewer localhost 5001 sample.rmi.CountApplet
</pre></ul>

<h3>7. sample/evolve/*.java</h3>

<p>   This is a demonstration of the class evolution mechanism implemented
   with Javassist.  This mechanism enables a Java program to reload an
   existing class file under some restriction.

<p>   To run, type the commands:
<ul><pre>
% javac -classpath ".:javassist.jar" sample/evolve/*.java
% java -cp ".:javassist.jar" sample.evolve.DemoLoader 5003
</pre></ul>

<p>   The second line starts a class loader DemoLoader, which runs a web
   server DemoServer listening to port 5003.

<p>   Then, open <a href="http://localhost:5003/demo.html">http://localhost:5003/demo.html</a> with a web browser running
   on the local host.
(Or, see <a href="sample/evolve/start.html">sample/evolve/start.html</a>.)

<h3>8. Hints</h3>

<p>Javassist provides a class file viewer for debugging.  For more details,
see javassist.Dump.

<p><br>

<h2>Changes</h2>

<p>- version 2.5.1 in May, 2003.
<br>Simple changes for integration with JBoss AOP
<ul>
  <li>Made ClassPool.get0 protected so that subclasses of ClassPool can call it.
  <li>Moved all access to the class cache (the field ClassPool.classes) to a method called getCached(String classname).  This is so subclasses of ClassPool can override this behavior.
</ul>

<p>- version 2.5 in May, 2003.
<br>From this version, Javassist is part of the JBoss project.
<ul>
  <li>The license was changed from MPL to MPL/LGPL dual.
  <li>ClassPool.removeClassPath() and ClassPath.close() have been added.
  <li>ClassPool.makeClass(InputStream) has been added.
  <li>CtClass.makeClassInitializer() has been added.
  <li>javassist.expr.Expr has been changed to a public class.
  <li>javassist.expr.Handler has been added.
  <li>javassist.expr.MethodCall.isSuper() has been added.
  <li>CtMethod.isEmpty() and CtConstructor.isEmpty() have been added.
  <li>LoaderClassPath has been implemented.
</ul>

<p>- version 2.4 in February, 2003.
<ul>
  <li>The compiler included in Javassist did not correctly work with
	interface methods.  This bug was fixed.
  <li>Now javassist.bytecode.Bytecode allows more than 255 local
	variables in the same method.
  <li>javassist.expr.Instanceof and Cast have been added.
  <li>javassist.expr.{MethodCall,NewExpr,FieldAccess,Instanceof,Cast}.where()
        have been added.  They return the caller-side method surrounding the
	expression.
  <li>javassist.expr.{MethodCall,NewExpr,FieldAccess,Instanceof,Cast}.mayThrow()
        have been added.
  <li>$class has been introduced.
  <li>The parameters to replaceFieldRead(), replaceFieldWrite(),
      and redirectFieldAccess() in javassist.CodeConverter are changed.
  <li>The compiler could not correctly handle a try-catch statement.
      This bug has been fixed.
</ul>

<p>- version 2.3 in December, 2002.
<ul>
  <li>The tutorial has been revised a bit.
  <li>SerialVersionUID class was donated by Bob Lee.  Thanks.
  <li>CtMethod.setBody() and CtConstructor.setBody() have been added.
  <li>javassist.reflect.ClassMetaobject.useContextClassLoader has been added.
  If true, the reflection package does not use Class.forName() but uses
  a context class loader specified by the user.
  <li>$sig and $type are now available.
  <li>Bugs in Bytecode.write() and read() have been fixed.
</ul>

<p>- version 2.2 in October, 2002.
<ul>
  <li>The tutorial has been revised.
  <li>A new package <code>javassist.expr</code> has been added.
        This is replacement of classic <code>CodeConverter</code>.
  <li>javassist.ConstParameter was changed into
	javassist.CtMethod.ConstParameter.
  <li>javassist.FieldInitializer was renamed into
	javassist.CtField.Initializer.
  <li>A bug in javassist.bytecode.Bytecode.addInvokeinterface() has been
	fixed.
  <li>In javassist.bytecode.Bytecode, addGetfield(), addGetstatic(),
	addInvokespecial(), addInvokestatic(), addInvokevirtual(),
	and addInvokeinterface()
	have been modified to update the current statck depth.
</ul>

<p>- version 2.1 in July, 2002.
<ul>
  <li>javassist.CtMember and javassist.CtBehavior have been added.
  <li>javassist.CtClass.toBytecode() has been added.
  <li>javassist.CtClass.toClass() and javassist.ClassPool.writeAsClass()
	has been added.
  <li>javassist.ByteArrayClassPath has been added.
  <li>javassist.bytecode.Mnemonic has been added.
  <li>Several bugs have been fixed.
</ul>

<p>- version 2.0 (major update) in November, 2001.
<ul>
  <li>The javassist.bytecode package has been provided.  It is a
    lower-level API for directly modifying a class file although
    the users must have detailed knowledge of the Java bytecode.

  <li>The mechanism for creating CtClass objects have been changed.

  <li>javassist.tool.Dump moves to the javassist package.
</ul>

<p>version 1.0 in July, 2001.
<ul>
  <li>javassist.reflect.Metaobject and ClassMetaobject was changed.
    Now they throw the same exception that they receive from a
    base-level object.
</ul>

<p>- version 0.8
<ul>
  <li>javassist.tool.Dump was added.  It is a class file viewer.

  <li>javassist.FiledInitializer.byNewArray() was added.  It is for
    initializing a field with an array object.

  <li>javassist.CodeConverter.redirectMethodCall() was added.

  <li>javassist.Run was added.
</ul>

<p>- version 0.7
<ul>
  <li>javassit.Loader was largely modified.  javassist.UserLoader was
    deleted.  Instead, Codebase was renamed to ClassPath
    and UserClassPath was added.  Now programmers who want to
    customize Loader must write a class implementing UserClassPath
    instead of UserLoader.  This change is for sharing class search paths
    between Loader and CtClass.CtClass(String).

  <li>CtClass.addField(), addMethod(), addConstructor(), addWrapper() were
    also largely modified so that it receives CtNewMethod, CtNewConstructor,
    or CtNewField.  The static methods for creating these objects were
    added to the API.

  <li>Constructors are now represented by CtConstructor objects.
    CtConstructor is a subclass of CtMethod.

  <li>CtClass.getUserAttribute() was removed.  Use CtClass.getAttribute().

  <li>javassist.rmi.RmiLoader was added.

  <li>javassist.reflect.Metalevel._setMetaobject() was added.  Now
    metaobjects can be replaced at runtime.
</ul>

<p>- version 0.6
<ul>
  <li>Javassist was modified to correctly deal with array types appearing
    in signatures.

  <li>A bug crashed resulting bytecode if a class includes a private static
    filed.  It has been fixed.

  <li>javassist.CtNewInterface was added.

  <li>javassist.Loader.recordClass() was renamed into makeClass().

  <li>javassist.UserLoader.loadClass() was changed to take the second
    parameter.
</ul>

<p>- version 0.5
<ul>
  <li>a bug-fix version.
</ul>

<p>- version 0.4
<ul>
  <li>Major update again.  Many classes and methods were changed.
    Most of methods taking java.lang.Class have been changed to
    take javassist.CtClass.
</ul>

<p>- version 0.3
<ul>
  <li>Major update.  Many classes and methods were changed.
</ul>

<p>- version 0.2
<ul>
  <li>Jar/zip files are supported.
</ul>

<p>-version 0.1 in April, 1999.
